## How to Get Around

### Rideshare

Uber and Lyft are everywhere and very convenient, like any major city. We find that an average ride within Boston costs about $7 - $14.

### Subway

If you're feeling adventurous and thrifty, the MBTA subway is also a great option. We recommend a day pass or weekend pass if you don't mind exploring at a slower pace.

### Walking & Biking

Boston is a relatively small city in terms of square mileage — it's easy to walk pretty much anywhere, and there are plenty of city bikes (and bike lanes!) available, too.
