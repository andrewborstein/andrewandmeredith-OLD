## When & Where

### Location

The **entire event** — ceremony, cocktails, dinner, and dancing — will be held at one of our favorite restaurants in Boston, [Alden & Harlow](http://www.aldenharlow.com). It's a cozy spot with a whole lot of character. And lucky for us, we'll have the whole place to ourselves.

### Schedule

We'll be celebrating together from **6:00 PM to 12:00 AM**, and here's a rough idea of what to expect:

**6:00 PM | Arrival.** Guests arrive and give each other hearty hellos and hugs.

**6:30 PM | Ceremony.** Andrew & Meredith say I do (and a few other cute things).

**7:00 PM | Cocktail Hour.** Everyone celebrates by mingling over some cocktails and appetizers.

**8:00 PM | Dinner.** Mingling continues and dinner fare materializes, buffet style. Some lovely people will make lovely toasts. Maybe a ceremonial dance or two featuring the newlyweds. 

**9:00 PM | Dancing.** Partayyyyyy tiiiiiime. Let's dance. No Macarena and no slow songs (no offense). Only 100% party jams. Don't forget to stop by the photo booth!

**11:30 PM | Wind Down.** Late night snacks and some bittersweet goodbyes. 

**12:00 AM | TBD.** After the party it's the afterparty.

## Transportation

### Rideshare

The Marriott in Kendall Square and Le Meridian in Central Square are both 10-15 min away by Uber/Lyft, even on a busy summer night. 

### Walking

If you end up at The Charles hotel you'll be walking distance, only about 2 blocks away.

If you're driving in, we would recommend using the parking garage nearby. Trying to find street parking in Boston will be basically impossible, but there are tons of other parking garages around Boston if you want to look elsewhere. 

## The Vibe

### Attire

The ceremony and dinner will not be fully seated, so you will likely be standing more than you would at a typical wedding. It's probably not the right night for your highest stilettos. Wear something fun! 

If you're looking for a little more direction, we'd recommend a "fancy date night" type of outfit. Anything more formal than jeans and less formal than a tuxedo is perfect. Morphsuits are highly encouraged.

### Menu

We haven't finalized a menu yet... but we promise it will taste good!  We hope that this will be the best food and drinks you have **ever** had at a wedding. Like the type you might have a few times a year on special occasions. 

There should be something for everyone — vegetarians and vegans, meat lovers, seafood fanatics, gluten no-thank-you-ers. And if need be, the wonderfully creative kitchen staff can make you something on the spot. If you're concerned about dietary restrictions, please let us know!  

## Kids

We love you and your offspring, and you are absolutely welcome to bring kids to the wedding! It seems to us like there isn't a ton of space in this setting for having fun if you're a kid, but maybe it's super fun for kids to go to a wedding? We don't know because we are child-less and bewildered/amazed by parenting. We are happy to answer any specific questions you may have that would help you decide if you will bring your kids or not. 

If you need special food accommodations (e.g. the kids would prefer chicken nuggets to chicken torchon), Alden & Harlow is prepared and happy to help.
