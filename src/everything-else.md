## Gifts

Your presence is gift enough! Seriously. 

All we want is for you to spend a Saturday night in Boston with us — and come ready to eat delicious food, drink amazing cocktails, and dance your faces off. Deal? Deal.

## Points of Interest

We made you this handy map! It's got all the major locations related to our wedding weekend, so you can see them all in one place. And we've also added recommendations for local places to eat, attractions to visit, and other things you might want to do while you're in town.

You can also [view the map full-screen](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1YViXbcdejBdYPMC9Q-rSpbtDueOqHOS2&hl=en&usp=sharing).

You can also easily save this to your personal Google account, so you can easily find it while you're logged into the Google Maps app.
